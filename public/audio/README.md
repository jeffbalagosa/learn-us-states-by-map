Please add three short, gentle audio clips here to enable audio feedback:

- `success.wav` — short positive chime.
- `error.wav` — short, soft negative tone.
- `complete.wav` — short completion/hint sound.

Files should be < 1s each and normalized so they are not loud when played at max volume 0.4.

If these files are not present, the app will use a small oscillator-based fallback tone for each event.
