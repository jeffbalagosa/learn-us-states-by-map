# Proposal: Add README

## Summary
Add a simple README.md file to the project root that provides basic information about the US States Quiz application. The README will serve as the entry point for users and developers to understand the project.

## Why
Currently, the project lacks a README.md file. A README is essential for:
- Introducing new users and contributors to the project
- Providing setup instructions
- Documenting basic usage
- Serving as a foundation for future documentation updates

## What Changes
This change introduces a minimal README.md that covers:
- Project description
- Features
- Getting started (installation and running the app)
- Tech stack overview
- Basic structure overview

The README will be intentionally simple and can be expanded in future changes as the application evolves.

## Risks
None - this is a documentation-only change with no code impact.
